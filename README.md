## How to install

### Building from source

This is currently the only method of installing the application.

 - Make sure you've installed stack, from https://haskellstack.org
 - Clone my fork of [discord-hs](https://github.com/jano017/Discord.hs) using
   `git clone https://github.com/Solonarv/Discord.hs.git`
 - Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Solonarv/shelter-bot.git`
 - Switch into the new folder with `cd shelter-bot`
 - Start the build process by running `./setup.sh`
 - Optionally, run `stack install` to make `shelter-bot` available on your path.
